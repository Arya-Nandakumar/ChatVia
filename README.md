## How this project was implemented
This project was developed using React as the frontend and Firebase as the backend.

Resorces that helped me learn about the fundamentals and got me started were :
* https://reactjs.org/
* https://firebase.google.com/docs/guides


I started the development by marking down the functionalities that I wanted in ChatVia and basically planned to create a real time private chat app like Omegle but more personalized.
The functionalities I had in mind to be implemented were :
* Ability to retrieve old messages
* User Authentication for login and register
* Messages to be saved, and retrievable later when user logs in again.

I was able to blend in and implement all these functionalities and build the app.
